# Module-1-Challenge

## Description

This project was created to allow greater accessibility to its users. By adding proper semantics and alt atributes, we are able to create a code that creates a cleaner code and much more accesible site. 

## Installation

This project was completed using starter code from gitHub by username urban-octo-telegram. It was then improved with html semantics. The only adjustment to code was either the removal of repetative functions, the renaming of divs, or the adjustment of spacing.

## Usage

After cloning the starter code to my computer and into my repository, I made sure throughout the project, that while altering the code, the webpage remained the same aestically. The goal was to alter semantics and increase the webpage's accessibility, not the webpage itself.

By comparing this to the starter code, we can learn a lot about efficient and neat coding that makes it easier to keep track of our work.
